The professionalism, motivation and dedication of my hobby job at weekend makes me encourage to share the beauty of the football competition as judge, as well as showing the human beings behind the figures seen by players and supporters on the pitch. Nowdays, I'm assitant referee and my task is support the referee decisions. First time it may looks like easier task than referee principal, but I'd like to ask you, reader, who support the decisions assistant referee? What if the referee assistant doesn't analyze properly the match situation? Maybe the referee principal will have a hard match to liderate.

· Which players are the most fighters? And who are the ones who receive the most cards from both teams?
· To the previous question, I wonder if the pattern of the older players are the most ball challengers and, on the other hand, the youngsters are calmer.
· Who is the scorer? Who is the most complete player?
· To the previous question, That forward player who stands out for having high scoring skills or ability will receive many more fouls than the rest of the team. This indicates that you should be alert: they will go after that player.
